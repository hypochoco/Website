#### Architecture

Lately, I’ve been interested in the applications of computer science in Architecture. The Boids project, for example, is a structure generated from Craig Reynolds’ classic algorithm that simulates flocking behavior in animals. By keeping a record of where each boid moves in relation to others, we're able to generate an interesting, organic structure.
