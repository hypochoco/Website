        I started this project way back in my Sophomore year of highschool. Back then, I wanted to make some kind of samurai-inspired character. They originally had bright pinkish armor and yellow/gold highlights. As my art style progressed, though, I’ve grown to like more muted colors and a duller appearance, which is a little closer to a ronin than a samurai. So, I detailed out a concept and then tried to redraw the concept in a posed rendering.

        As a fun side-note, I used to try for a more graphic style. Rather than painting, I’d use the Photoshop lasso tool to pick out shapes and then a textured brush to fill these selections. Looking back at it now, it didn’t turn out too bad. It’s not great, but there are some interesting parts to look at.

        I initially tried a pose where the character was falling away from the camera, but it didn’t really make much sense. It didn’t have much gesture, and I generally had a rough time trying to figure out the anatomy. So, I moved on and tried a different pose.

        This pose is a little more active . Rather than falling away from the camera, they go toward it. The anatomy was a bit easier to work with, and I overall liked the composition. After looking at it now though, I wish I had worked on the background a little more. It’s definitely a little too bare and doesn’t serve to enhance the image. Moreover, I also think I could’ve worked harder on the waist area. Compared to the concept drawings, it’s missing the same amount of visual complexity and looks like it was lost in translation. The clothing folds around that area, too, are done quite lazily and could’ve used some more attention.

        Here, I decided to just cut off part of the cloth at the bottom of the image by cropping it because I didn’t want to bother rendering it. I also suffer from trying to make the drawing too controlled too quickly. I lost the complexity, especially in the hip area, because I started rendering this portion before it was better sketched out.

        Overall, it’s not bad, but worth a revisit. I like the initial concept drawing, but I definitely think I could do better on the rendering. I’d probably first improve on the pose and background, and then keep the painting more loose.
